  Hi, my name is Max and I'm a senior test automation engineer.  
  I like to build tools/libraries to solve my job's problems, it is exciting to watch how my solution fits in.  
  I am working on data analysis and visualization for quality reports and observations for problem-solving.  
  On top of that, I have cumulated years of experience in building and designing an in-house Selenium library as well as Jenkins pipeline with Ansible and Chef.

            Handy library for retrieving big results
          description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            This library is trying to create a convenient way of pulling the results and case info from 
            Testrails(A Test management system) for analytic purposes. 
            With the help of [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), we are gaining flexibility and speed in exploring the data.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I started this project during a hackathon event. We are using [Testrail](https://www.gurock.com/testrail/) 
          as our [Test Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Oracle). To publish the results, it often troublesome
          due to some dependencies behind the pipelines, which can be simplify through this solution.

            PCEF (policy charging enforcement function) is an element mainly used by the Telecommunication 
            industry. Since the PCRF software is implemented against the standard defined by 
            3GPP(3rd Generation Partnership Project), requirement for shipping user interface to 
            different PCEF vendors is important. 
            I am responsible for developing a Web base configuration system to manage 
            the rule configuration on PCRF.

            Maintaining existing product, XSL IDE, is a proprietery IDE to do with Extensible Style Language (XSL). 
            A new copy of XSL will be generated after retrieving information from DDR. 
            The xsl then will be passed to a translation engine to translate a best viewed HTML or WAP 
            page for a particular mobile device that is visiting the portal. 
            For the sake of easy maintenance and time saving, XSL IDE is created.

            Mobile Phone Communication system.  The application consists of server and client.  
            Server required to hold socket connections from clients and establishes messenger 
            sessions to messenger providers (MSN, Yahoo etc). 
            Client was developed by J2ME to support most phones in the market with a single set of source code. 
            We were implementing a dynamic native Graphic User Interface (GUI) which can populate a set 
            of GUI that suite all devices. Reason of using native graphics is to present an interactive, 
            attractive and cool interface like we have in game applications.
