        description: |
          This project automates the process of creating test plans, executions, 
          and tests in Xray by translating data from a cucumber.json result file. 
          The tool imports the data and automatically creates the necessary test assets in Xray, 
          streamlining the process and reducing the risk of errors. 
          Additionally, the tool exports the results back into the respective executions, 
          making it easier to track and manage testing progress. 
          Overall, this project improves the efficiency and accuracy of the testing process 
          by automating the creation and management of test assets in Xray.

          Track your daily environment release effortlessly.
        description: |
          A tool for automating the versioning process of software releases. 
          It has several key features that streamline the versioning process and ensure that releases are properly labeled and tracked.

          The first feature is the auto-generation of semantic-environment_aware-timebased version numbers. 
          This means that the tool will automatically create a version number that includes information about the release, 
          such as the environment it's intended for (in this case SIT), and the date on which it was generated (in this case 2023.03.17). 
          This helps to ensure that each version is uniquely identified and can be easily tracked.

          The second feature is the ability to update the "fixVersion" field in Jira issues to reflect the daily generated version. 
          This helps to keep track of which issues have been addressed in which versions,
          making it easier to track progress and identify any issues that may have been introduced in a particular release.

          Finally, the tool includes a mechanism for automatically getting the latest version when it enters into a new day window. 
          This ensures that the version numbers stay current and 
          are always accurately reflecting the most recent changes and updates to the software.

          Overall, this project is designed to simplify the versioning process and ensure that releases are properly labeled and tracked, 
          making it easier to manage software development and releases over time.

          Xray result importer script
        description: |
          This project is a library for importing the results of Postman executions into Jira Xray. 
          This allows for easier tracking and management of test results, 
          ensuring that all relevant data is captured and organized in a central location.

          The library works by integrating with both Postman and Jira Xray, 
          allowing for seamless transfer of data between the two systems. 
          After each Postman execution, the library will automatically import the results into Jira Xray, 
          creating a new test execution and associating it with the appropriate test case.

          This process ensures that all test results are accurately tracked and stored, 
          making it easier to analyze and report on test results over time. 
          It also eliminates the need for manual data entry, reducing the risk of errors and streamlining the testing process.

          Overall, this project is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the testing process by 
          automating the import of test results from Postman into Jira Xray. 
          By ensuring that all test results are accurately tracked and managed, 
          this library helps to ensure the quality, reliability and reusability of multiple Postman Collections,
          leading to increased of collaboration and maintainability.

          This library is trying to create a convenient way of pulling the results and case info from 
          Testrails(A Test management system) for analytic purposes. 
          With the help of [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), we are gaining flexibility and speed in exploring the data.

          I started this project during a hackathon event. We are using [Testrail](https://www.gurock.com/testrail/) 
          as our [Test Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Oracle). To publish the results, it often troublesome
          due to some dependencies behind the pipelines, which can be simplify through this solution.

            A new copy of XSL will be generated after retrieving information from DDR. 
            The xsl then will be passed to a translation engine to translate a best viewed HTML or WAP 
            page for a particular mobile device that is visiting the portal. 
            For the sake of easy maintenance and time saving, XSL IDE is created. 
            It produces a startup template and graphical based tree view to edit a XSL document.
