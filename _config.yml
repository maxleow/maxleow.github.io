        description: |
          This project automates the process of creating test plans, executions, 
          and tests in Xray by translating data from a cucumber.json result file. 
          The tool imports the data and automatically creates the necessary test assets in Xray, 
          streamlining the process and reducing the risk of errors. 
          Additionally, the tool exports the results back into the respective executions, 
          making it easier to track and manage testing progress. 
          Overall, this project improves the efficiency and accuracy of the testing process 
          by automating the creation and management of test assets in Xray.

          Track your daily environment release effortlessly.
        description: |
          The project you're describing is a tool for automating the versioning process of software releases. 
          It has several key features that streamline the versioning process and ensure that releases are properly labeled and tracked.

          The first feature is the auto-generation of semantic-environment_aware-timebased version numbers. 
          This means that the tool will automatically create a version number that includes information about the release, 
          such as the environment it's intended for (in this case SIT), and the date on which it was generated (in this case 2023.03.17). 
          This helps to ensure that each version is uniquely identified and can be easily tracked.

          The second feature is the ability to update the "fixVersion" field in Jira issues to reflect the daily generated version. 
          This helps to keep track of which issues have been addressed in which versions,
          making it easier to track progress and identify any issues that may have been introduced in a particular release.

          Finally, the tool includes a mechanism for automatically getting the latest version when it enters into a new day window. 
          This ensures that the version numbers stay current and 
          are always accurately reflecting the most recent changes and updates to the software.

          Overall, this project is designed to simplify the versioning process and ensure that releases are properly labeled and tracked, 
          making it easier to manage software development and releases over time.

          Xray result importer script
        description: |
          This project is a tool for importing the results of Postman executions into Jira Xray. 
          This allows for easier tracking and management of test results, 
          ensuring that all relevant data is captured and organized in a central location.

          The tool works by integrating with both Postman and Jira Xray, 
          allowing for seamless transfer of data between the two systems. 
          After each Postman execution, the tool will automatically import the results into Jira Xray, 
          creating a new test execution and associating it with the appropriate test case.

          This process ensures that all test results are accurately tracked and stored, 
          making it easier to analyze and report on test results over time. 
          It also eliminates the need for manual data entry, reducing the risk of errors and streamlining the testing process.

          Overall, this project is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the testing process by 
          automating the import of test results from Postman into Jira Xray. 
          By ensuring that all test results are accurately tracked and managed, 
          this tool helps to ensure the quality and reliability of software releases, 
          leading to increased customer satisfaction and business success.

            ## 2022 December - Present (QA Lead)
            During my work, I successfully implemented a pipeline that collected build information from Tekton pipelines, 
            allowing for easy access and retrieval of important data. 
            I then utilized AWS Athena and crawler to effectively manipulate and organize this data, 
            enabling me to gain valuable insights and identify key trends. Finally, 
            I leveraged AWS Quicksight to create an intuitive and informative QA dashboard, 
            providing stakeholders with real-time visibility into project status and enabling informed decision-making.

            In addition to the tasks mentioned earlier, 
            I also played a key role in driving a performance test transformation from JMeter to Locust, 
            an open-source load testing tool that provides more flexibility and scalability. 
            This transition involved carefully evaluating the needs of the project and determining the most appropriate tool for the job, 
            as well as designing and implementing an effective migration plan. Through this effort, 
            we were able to significantly improve our performance testing capabilities and deliver more accurate and reliable results.

            ---------------------- 

            ## 2022 November - December
            I automated the quality check process for every code change committed to AWS codecommit, 
            which included validating Jira keys and author email. 
            This automation helped to ensure that all code changes met the required standards and guidelines, 
            saving time and effort for the development team. 
            Furthermore, I extended the automation bot to Jira comments, 
            reporting the deployment status on each environment. 
            This allowed for improved visibility and streamlined communication across the project team, 
            enabling prompt and effective decision-making.

            ---------------------- 

            ## 2022 September - 2022 November
            Designed and automated API user journey flows using Postman, Tekton and Xray, 
            solved test data consistency issues, established a monitoring process for test scripts and product defects, 
            and provided guidance, training, and coaching to enhance the process and improve team skills. 
            These efforts significantly improved the project's quality and efficiency while enhancing team capabilities.
