</p><p>A tool for automating the versioning process of software releases. 
It has several key features that streamline the versioning process and ensure that releases are properly labeled and tracked.</p>

<p>The first feature is the auto-generation of semantic-environment_aware-timebased version numbers. 
This means that the tool will automatically create a version number that includes information about the release, 
such as the environment it’s intended for (in this case SIT), and the date on which it was generated (in this case 2023.03.17). 
This helps to ensure that each version is uniquely identified and can be easily tracked.</p>

<p>The second feature is the ability to update the “fixVersion” field in Jira issues to reflect the daily generated version. 
This helps to keep track of which issues have been addressed in which versions,
making it easier to track progress and identify any issues that may have been introduced in a particular release.</p>

<p>Finally, the tool includes a mechanism for automatically getting the latest version when it enters into a new day window. 
This ensures that the version numbers stay current and 
are always accurately reflecting the most recent changes and updates to the software.</p>

<p>Overall, this project is designed to simplify the versioning process and ensure that releases are properly labeled and tracked, 
making it easier to manage software development and releases over time.</p>

This allows for easier tracking and management of test results, 
ensuring that all relevant data is captured and organized in a central location.</p>

<p>The library works by integrating with both Postman and Jira Xray, 
allowing for seamless transfer of data between the two systems. 
After each Postman execution, the library will automatically import the results into Jira Xray, 
creating a new test execution and associating it with the appropriate test case.</p>

<p>This process ensures that all test results are accurately tracked and stored, 
making it easier to analyze and report on test results over time. 
It also eliminates the need for manual data entry, reducing the risk of errors and streamlining the testing process.</p>

<p>Overall, this project is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the testing process by 
automating the import of test results from Postman into Jira Xray. 
By ensuring that all test results are accurately tracked and managed, 
this library helps to ensure the quality, reliability and reusability of multiple Postman Collections,
leading to increased of collaboration and maintainability.</p>

page for a particular mobile device that is visiting the portal. 
For the sake of easy maintenance and time saving, XSL IDE is created. 
It produces a startup template and graphical based tree view to edit a XSL document. 
XSL IDE is implementing a generic Swing IDE platform which we are using Netbeans Platform.
